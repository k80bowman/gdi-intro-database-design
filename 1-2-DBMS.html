          <h3>How do I work with a database?</h3>
          <h5>Use a database management system - a DBMS!</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Connects the data, the user, and other applications.</li>
            <li>Definition of the database!</li>
            <li>Creation of the database!</li>
            <li>Queries of the data!</li>
            <li>Updates to the data!</li>
            <li>Administration of the database!</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>DBMS options</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Microsoft SQL Server</li>
            <li>Oracle</li>
            <li>IBM’s DB2</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>Microsoft Access</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Access is not generally considered an industrial-strength, "professional" DBMS, but it definitely has its strengths.
          For one, it is part of Microsoft Office, so it has a UI we can all use intuitively. You may not see Access at somewhere
          like Sparkbox or a big enterprise, but a lot of small places, somewhere like a small business or a school at a university,
          would have good reason to use Access.

          By the way -you’re going to see the three letters “SQL” quite a bit in this class. How is it pronounced?
          SQL was originally called SEQUAL, but of course now it’s obviously spelled SQL, but seuql is easier to say.
          It’s a whole thing that shouldn’t be a thing, I recommend using whatever your boss uses and then you’ll be safe. </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>What does a DBMS do for me?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Levels of data</li>
            <li>Storage</li>
            <li>Data integrity</li>
            <li>Data consistency</li>
            <li>Performance</li>
            <li>Security</li>
            <li>Backup and recovery</li>
            <li>And some other stuff...</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Levels of Data</h3>
          <p>Three views provided by the DBMS</p>
          <aside class="notes"> When I say views here I don’t mean the stored query we just learned about - I mean it’s literally a way to see the database. </aside>
          <ul>
            <li>External level
              <ul>
                <li>How each group of end-users sees the organization of data in the database.</li>
                <li>Can be any number of these - allows users to see their own businessy ways!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Conceptual/logical level
              <ul>
                <li>Unifies all of the external views.</li>
                <li>If you’re a database application developer, this is the view you would use to write code against</li>
                <li>Only 1</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          <li>Conceptual/logical level
            <ul>
              <li>Internal organization of data in a DBMS.</li>
              <li>Only 1</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Data Independence</h3>
          <p>Changes made at one level do not affect a view at another level.</p>
          <aside class="notes">So, for example, an end user can change their external view and it doesn’t affect a database application developer’s code at the conceptual level!</aside>
          <p>Independence hides the details of the storage structure from user applications.</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Physical independence</b> = ability to modify the physical schema without causing application programs to be rewritten. </li>
            <aside class="notes">So you can make physical changes to the database, for optimization for example, without changing the application</aside>
            <li><b>Logical independence</b> = ability to modify the logical schema without causing application programs to be rewritten.</li>
            <aside class="notes">If we add some new columns or remove some columns from a table then the user view and programs should not change.</aside>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <p>The internal level of the database architecture + metadata and data structures.</p>
          <aside class="notes">includes schemas, tables, queries, views, etc.</aside>
          <p>Serious optimization happens at the storage/internal level of the database so that the database is fast and efficient when data is requested.</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Database engine</b> = underlying software a DBMS uses to manipulate the data.</li>
            <aside class="notes">DBMS allows access to the engine through the UI or possibly through an API so that humans can hit it.</aside>
            <li><b>Database replication</b> = replicating data in order to increase availability and resiliency.</li>
            <aside class="notes">Availability = more people can access the same piece of data with good performance
                 Resiliency = data is backed up in case of a failure</aside>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
          <p>Ensuring valid data.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Data types</b> ensure that, for example, date fields only store date values.</li>
            <aside class="notes">So just like we can give a variable a datatype in programming and only values of that datatype are allowed ot be saved there,
            we can give a field in a database a type and the DBMS will control that.</aside>
            <li>Constraints and triggers allow for complex rules to be applied
              <ul>
                <li><b>Constraint</b> = limit the type of data that can go in a table, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Can be column-level or table-level.</li>
                    <li>examples: Not Null, Unique, Primary Key, Default</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Trigger</b> = action (code) that is run automatically in response to a certain event.</li>
                <aside class="notes">Examples of triggers: every time a new employee is added, create entries for that person in the tax and benefits table.
                  Or before a customer is deleted, confirm they do not have an outstanding order, and prevent the deletion if so.</aside>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Data Consistency</h3>
          <p>Ensuring the database is in a valid state.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Record locks prevent “dirty” reads or writes.
              <ul>
                <li><b>Record locking</b> = preventing simultaneous access to data.</li>
                <aside class="notes">Perfect example of dirty read/write is 2 bank clerks trying to modify 1 bank account. The 1st clerk makes a quick update and saves it.
                  Then the 2nd clerk makes their update and saves it, effectively erasing the first transaction entirely. The solution is to lock the record after the first
                  person retrieves the data, then unlock it once that change is saved.</aside>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Commit and rollback</b> mechanisms ensure transactions are either fully completed or fully rolled back.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Performance</h3>
          <p>Fine-grained record locking prevents queries from blocking others.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Indexes speed up lookups and joins by magnitudes.
              <ul>
                <li><b>Index</b> = data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Query optimizers find the fastest way to execute your query.</li>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Query optimizer</b> = determine the most efficient way to execute a given query internally.</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>People or code may be restricted in what database objects they can control or which computations they can make</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Multi-tiered security</b> allows restrictions at the server level, database level, column level, role level, and user level.</li>
            <li>Databases also often have change and access logs - what was changed, when it was changed, and by whom it was changed.</li>
            <li>Can use <b>database transactions</b> to increase security.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Backup and Recovery</h3>
          <p>Use tools for backup and recovery! Log files make it possible.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Database mirroring</b> = creation and maintenance of redundant copies of a database. Ensures continuous availability.</li>
            <li><b>Failover clustering</b> = creation and maintenance of groups of servers that work in the same way to ensure high availability of data.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>And some other DBMS features...</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Materialized view</b> = saved result of a frequently needed query.</li>
            <aside class="notes">Materialized view = view but data is saved and only updated periodically. So can be older data, but is available instantly.</aside>
            <li><b>Migration</b> = moving a database from one DBMS to another. Typically a DBMS will include import tools.</li>
            <li>Graphics component for producing graphs and charts</li>
            <li>Tools for design, programming, maintenance, performance analysis, configuration, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Transaction</h3>
          <p>1 unit of work performed within a DBMS against a database. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>They provide reliable units of work to allow a recovery from a failure.</li>
            <li>They provide isolation between programs hitting a database at the same time.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Transactions are <b>ACID</b>!
          <aside class="notes">Transactions can be used to increase a lot of the elements of a database we've already talked about - security, data integrity, data consistency, etc..</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID</h3>
          <p><b>A</b>tomicity = a transaction must be all or nothing. If one part of a transaction fails, it all fails and the database is left unchanged.</p>
          <p><b>C</b>onsistency = any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another; invalid data causes transactions to roll back. Any data must align with all constraints and triggers.</p>
          <p><b>I</b>solation = concurrent transactions result in the same state as sequential transactions; all transactions are independent! </p>
          <p><b>D</b>urability = once a transaction is complete, it is permanent - even if the system fails (power loss, crash, etc.).</p>
          <aside class="notes">These definitions are dense, but the concepts are super easy to describe with simple examples.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID</h3>
          <p>Imagine moving $100 from your checking account to your savings account.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Confirm the accounts are valid.</li>
            <li>Confirm the checking account has available funds.</li>
            <li>Debit the checking account $100.</li>
            <li>Credit the savings account $100.</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID - Atomicity</h3>
          <p>Case 1: The building loses power between debiting checkings and crediting savings.</p>
          <p>Because the transaction was not fully committed, <b>atomicity</b> ensures that the transaction is rolled back. </p>
          <p>(This is <b>commit and rollback</b>!)</p>
          <aside class="notes">Remember atomicity says that a transaction must be all or nothing. If one part of a transaction fails, it all fails and the database is left unchanged.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID - Consistency</h3>
          <p>Case 2: Memory corruption causes a credit savings by $1,000,000 instead of $100.</p>
          <p>Because the transaction leaves the system in an inconsistent state, <b>consistency</b> will ensure that the transaction is rolled back (sorry!).</p>
          <aside class="notes">Remember consistency is that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another; invalid data causes transactions to roll back.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID - Isolation</h3>
          <p>Case 3: At the same time that you transfer funds, your utility cashes a check that brings your checking balance to $50.</p>
          <p><b>Isolation</b> ensures that either the utility clears before your transaction (meaning your transaction will be rejected) or your transaction finishes first (meaning the utility check will bounce).</p>
          <p>(This is <b>record locking</b>!)</p>
          <aside class="notes">Remember isolation means all transactions are independent.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>ACID - Durability</h3>
          <p>Case 4: The building loses power right after your transaction completes.</p>
          <p><b>Durability</b> ensures that the transaction is permanent.</p>
          <aside class="notes">Remember durability means once a transaction is complete, it is permanent.</aside>
