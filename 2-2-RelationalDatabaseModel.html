          <h3>Relational Databases - Why?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>ACID makes it reliable for critical transactional systems.</li>
            <li>Acts as an all-purpose database.
              <ul>
                <li>Older models did not perform well; they encouraged redundant and inaccurate data.</li>
                <li>Newer models are more specialty - solve a problem in one area but come at a high cost in other areas.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Relational Databases - Why?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A set of rules called the <b>normal forms</b> ensures data redundancy is reduced and data integrity is upheld.</li>
            <li>The process of applying the normal forms is called <b>normalization</b>.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Decomposition</h3>
          <p>= the process of splitting data into tables.</p>
          <img alt="A decomposition plan for Pet DB" src="dist/img/DecompositionPlan.JPG" />
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Decomposition - back to the normal forms</h3>
          <p>If we follow the normal forms when decomposing, then we are guaranteed we will be able to reconstruct the data.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Decomposition - First Normal Form</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Eliminate repeating groups in individual tables.</li>
            <li>Create a separate table for each set of related data.</li>
            <li>Identify each set of related data with a primary key.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Decomposition - Second Normal Form</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1NF.</li>
            <li>Every non-prime attribute of the relation is dependent on the whole of every candidate key.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Said more simply, all non-key columns are dependent on the table's primary key.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Decomposition - Third Normal Form</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2NF.</li>
            <li>All the attributes in a table are determined only by the candidate keys of that relation and not by any non-prime attributes.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Third normal form = none of the values can be extrapolated from or rely on a secondary field.
              So imagine a table with three columns - name, birthday, and age. Well age can be easily extrapolated from birthday. If we update the birthday and
              not the age, we’d have conflicting data. This is a super simple example of a table which does not meet the criteria for third normal form.</aside>

          <h3>Joins</h3>
          <p>We put the data back together by <b>joining</b> tables</p>

          <h3>Joins</h3>
          <p>Every row in the pet table is matched to a row in the owner table.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Explain how to find the join of pets and owners on Pet Name = Owner First.
            First Find every Owner where Owner First = Robigo, then Owner First = Tabytha, etc.</aside>

        <section>
          <h3>Joins</h3>
          <p>The result: Pets &#10781 Owners on Pet Name = Owner First</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Joins</h3>
          <p>During decomposition, we always copy a certain field to each table to serve as the relationship.</p>
          <img alt="Owner First column added to Pets table" src="dist/img/ConnectingField.JPG" />
          <p>What is Pets &#10781 Owners on Owner First = Owner First?</p>
          <aside class="notes">We can’t just match on pet name and owner name. We have to deliberately build our tables
            so that we have a field to match on. We have to be intentional with our relationships.</aside>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key</h3>
          <p>What is Pets &#10781 Owners on Owner First = Owner First?</p>
          <img alt="Pets and Owners joined on Owner First" src="dist/img/JoinedOnOwnerFirst.JPG" />
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A field (or set of fields) that uniquely identify rows.</li>
            <li>The minimal set of fields upon which the row is <b>functionally dependent</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key - Functional Dependency</h3>
          <p>Let A and B be sets of fields in a table.</p>
          <p>A functional dependency exists (A → B) if for every field[A] in the table we get back row[B].</p>
          <aside class="notes">Suppose one is designing a system to track vehicles and the capacity of their engines. Each vehicle has a unique vehicle
            identification number (VIN). One would write VIN → EngineCapacity because it would be inappropriate for a vehicle's engine to have more than one capacity.
            (Assuming, in this case, that vehicles only have one engine.) Transversely, EngineCapacity → VIN is incorrect because there could be many vehicles with the
            same engine capacity.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Functional Dependency</h3>
          <img alt="A small functionally dependent example" src="dist/img/FunctionalDependency1.JPG" />
          <p>Let A = (Owner First), B = (Owner Last). Can we say A → B?</p>
          <aside class="notes">Yes, in this small dataset. In this case, B → A as well. But, if you imagine that this were John Doe instead of John Smith, the dataset would
            still have A → B but would no longer have B → A.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Functional Dependency</h3>
          <img alt="A small functionally independent example" src="dist/img/FunctionalDependency2.JPG" />
          <p>Let A = (Owner First), B = (Owner Last). Can we say A → B?</p>
          <aside class="notes">No.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Functional Dependency</h3>
          <img alt="Pet DB functional dependency" src="dist/img/PetDBFunctionalDependency.JPG" />
          <p>Let A = (Owner First, Pet Name), B = (rest of pet facts). Can we say A → B?</p>
          <aside class="notes">Yes, so we can use the combination of owner first and pet name to look up all of the pet facts.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key Candidate</h3>
          <img alt="Pet DB functional dependency" src="dist/img/PetDBFunctionalDependency.JPG" />
          <p>Every time I see a particular Owner First + Pet Name, I expect to get back the same Pet Birthday, Pet Color, and Pet Skill.</p>
          <p>Does the reverse hold true?</p>
          <aside class="notes">No, functional dependency is a one-way street. Pets could have identical birthdays, colors, and skills, but
            have a different name and/or owner. The same person having two identical pets, including name, is not a valid business case in this situation.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>The PK must be unique within the table.</li>
            <li>Only one PK is allowed per table.</li>
            <li>The PK is automatically indexed (for fast lookup!).</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">So you may set something like an SSN or an Order Number may make a good key. HOWEVER (and this is where we return to the Pet DB)</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key Candidate</h3>
          <img alt="Names not working for PK" src="dist/img/NamesNotGoodKeys.JPG" />
          <p>PKs must be unique within the table - for this reason, names make poor PKs.</p>
          <aside class="notes">It’s easy to see how a in a table like this, it may be tough or impossible to find a foreign key.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key Candidate</h3>
          <img alt="ID field added to Owner table" src="dist/img/AddingIDField.JPG" />
          <p>For this reason, you’ll usually see a unique ID field used as a PK.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key</h3>
          <p>Primary keys are often “ID” fields in all tables.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This is partly done for convenience
              <ul><li>ID fields are often autoincrement fields</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Remember PKs are automatically indexed, and numbers are faster to increment.</li>
            <li>Other tables may refer back to another table’s PK, and it’s easier and faster to bring in one column instead of multiple.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Also - having only one column as the PK is significantly faster than having two like we had in the Pets table.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Primary Key</h3>
          <img alt="ID field added to pets table" src="dist/img/PKAddedToPets.JPG" />
          <aside class="notes">We already added our PK to the owner table - here it is added to the Pets table. Now, instead of Owner First + Pet Name
            being the only way to identify records, we have a column we know will always be unique.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
          <p>= a field (or set of fields) that is a PK in some other table.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There can be multiple FKs in a table</li>
            <li>FKs are how you designate that tables are related.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">So you remember about 60 slides ago when we were joining Pets and Owners on Owner first? And I said remember
            this spot because we're going to come back to it after we learn about keys?</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
          <img alt="Tables not yet formally connected" src="dist/img/DisconnectedTables.JPG" />
          <p>These tables are not yet formally connected in any way!</p>
          <aside class="notes">These tables are connected on Owner First, but we know Owner First could very easily be duplicated in
            the Owners table, so it isn’t unique in any way. Also, since it’s not a key in Owners, it’s not a Foreign Key.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
          <img alt="Tables connected by a FK" src="dist/img/AddFKToPets.JPG" />
          <p>These tables are now related!</p>
          <aside class="notes">If we replace Owner First with Owner_Id, we’ve created a link between the two tables which is indisputable. It’s a foreign key!</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Referential Integrity</h3>
          <p>A database has <b>referential integrity</b> if rules are in place that ensure that a FK can never point to a row that doesn’t exist.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Foreign Key</h3>
          <img alt="Row is deleted, so we now have orphan rows" src="dist/img/OrphanRows.JPG" />
          <p>Pet_IDs 3 and 5 have become orphan rows :(</p>
          <aside class="notes">If something happens to the second owner, what will happen to the 3rd and 4th pets? There are two ways to deal with the illegal
            action of deleting the second owner.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Referential Constraints</h3>
          <p><b>Cascade</b> = cascade changes in PK to all referencing FKs.</p>
          <br /><br />
          <p><b>Restrict</b> (or <b>no action</b>) = don’t allow changes to PK if there is a referencing FK.</p>
          <aside class="notes">So if we set our preferences to cascade deletions, when we deleted the second owner we would also delete the third and fifth pets.
            If we set our preferences to restrict deletions, when we attempt to delete the second owner we would get an error.
            This doesn’t just apply to deletions - the same would happen, depending on our chosen constraint, if we for example changed the value of the PK.
            So if we chose cascade and then changed the second Owner’s PK to 3, that change would cascade through the Pet table and change the third and fifth pet’s
            owner FK to 3.

          <h3>Indexes</h3>
          <p>= a special data structure that speeds up data retrieval.</p>
          <img alt="A cat reading a newspaper" src="dist\img\ReadingCat.jpg" />
          <p>Consider the task of trying to find all references to an “Anna” character in War and Peace.</p>
          <aside class="notes">You may remember that we learned that PKs are automatically indexed, and then didn’t really talk about what an index is.
            If all we have is the novel, we basically just have to read or scan the entire massive novel. However, if the novel had an index, we can look
            Anna up in the index and then go directly to the pages she’s on. An index on a field in a database works in a similar way, using a special data structure
            called a b-tree.
            Back to PKs being automatically indexed - when keys are indexed it makes joining two or more tables vastly faster.
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Indexes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Indexes slow down writes</li>
            <li>Too many indexes can slow down queries</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So it’s a tradeoff! </p>
          <aside class="notes">So why don’t we just index every field, since they vastly improve performance?</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Indexes</h3>
          <p>What fields should be indexed?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PKs are automatically indexed.</li>
            <li>FKs, especially if you enforce referential integrity</li>
            <li>Fields which will be queried over and over
              <ul>
                <li>Name fields</li>
                <li>Phone number, if your system looks people up by phone</li>
                <li>State, if producing mass mailings by state</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">Remember referential integrity means that rules are in place that ensure that a FK can never point to a row that doesn’t exist.
            So really beyond the keys, it’s up to you or your business rules to determine which fields should be indexed.</aside>
