## Course description
Database design is the science (and art) of storing and retrieving data.  As anyone who has tried to analyze data using Excel can attest, it is not as simple as it might seem.   

Are you a developer (web or otherwise) who wants to learn more about the backend stack? Are you an analyst who would like to learn why your reports take time to build and run? Are you a business owner or hobbyist who'd like to design your own database system? Or, maybe you're thinking about becoming a database professional? If you answered yes to any of the questions above or are just generally interested in learning more about databases—this class will get you started.

No prior experience is necessary in this introductory course where we will dive deep into the foundations of relational database design.  

We will cover many intriguing topics such as:

• How do you choose a primary key?  

• How do you slice your data into tables?

• What does it mean when someone asks if your database has been "normalized"?

• What is referential integrity?  

• What is so special about an index?

### Prerequisites:
There are no prerequisites for this class.

This course is specifically for beginners and we advise experienced developers to not take this class

### What to bring:

• A notebook, a laptop is optional
